### Hi, I’m Naghmeh (Nelly)

I’m a computational biologist working at the intersection of
single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, explainable machine learning,
and mechanistic systems biology.

My work focuses on translating complex experimental data into
biologically interpretable and reproducible models that support
hypothesis generation, experimental validation, and discovery.

**Core interests**
- Single-cell & spatial omics
- Multimodal integration (RNA, ATAC, spatial)
- Explainable ML for biomarker discovery
- Causal and mechanistic modeling
- Reproducible HPC workflows
